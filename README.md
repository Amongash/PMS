# Parcel Management System

This is a simple implementation of a Parcel Management System built on top of React and NodeJS.
The client folder represents the frontend while the server folder represents the backend.

To run the applications, NodeJS and npm need to be installed.

## Quick start

### 1. Frontend:

`cd client` <br />
Run `npm install` to install dependencies <br />
Create an `.env` file by renaming the `.env.example` file <br />
Run `npm start` to start the application <br />

###2. Backend API:

The backend API utilizes MongoDB for data storage. MongoDB is thus required for the functioning of the API.

`cd server` <br />
Run `npm install` to install dependencies <br />
Create an `.env` file by renaming the `.env.example` file <br />
Run `npm start` to start the application <br />
